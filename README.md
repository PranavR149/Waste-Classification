# Project Description

This is a project based on Deep Learning (CNN) and Python. The main aim of this project is to classify the waste materials based on the images given as inputs.

The Waste Classification project, utilizing cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow, addresses the critical need for automated waste sorting in the realm of environmental sustainability. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this project offers an innovative solution to categorize diverse waste items efficiently. The meticulously curated dataset undergoes preprocessing and data augmentation for robust model training. The CNN architecture, featuring convolutional and max-pooling layers, captures intricate patterns for accurate classification.

Training is orchestrated with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, while visualizations track the model's learning journey. The resultant model exhibits impressive accuracy in predicting waste types, providing a valuable tool for waste management systems. To ensure accessibility and reproducibility, the model is versioned and saved to a dedicated directory. This project not only showcases the prowess of AI in waste categorization but also contributes to the broader mission of creating smarter, eco-friendly solutions for a sustainable future.

Technologies Used: TensorFlow, Python, Matplotlib, TensorFlow Keras API.
